      " An opinion piece (Starmer was right to exile Corbyn…, 19 February, p33) said Jeremy Corbyn had in 2020 “accused the EHRC of ‘dramatically overstating’ the extent of antisemitism in the [Labour] party”; while Corbyn said he did not accept all of the Equalities and Human Rights Commission’s findings, it was in fact opponents and the media he accused of overstating the problem. The article also said Neil Kinnock told Labour’s 2010 conference: “We’ve got our party back”. This was a comment he recounted a trade unionist making to him at the conference after Ed Miliband was elected leader – to which Kinnock replied: “We never lost it”.\n",

InstaVolt has told us its business model means it does not have such sourcing issues and has not been affected by global semiconductor shortages ( If you’re taking the Tesla to Truro this summer, you’d better plan ahead, 19 February, p3).\n",
